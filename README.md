# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### Project Overview
This project builds two different CNN models to classify CIFAR-10 images:

#### LeNet-5 CNN Model:
- A CNN model based on the classic LeNet-5 architecture, which is known for its success in early image classification tasks.

#### Custom CNN Model:
- A custom-designed CNN architecture to achieve higher accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
