# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
